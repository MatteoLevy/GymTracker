# GymTracker
Welcome to GymTracker! GymTracker is a minimalistic app to track workouts.

## Background
I train at the gym and I use Google Keep to register my workouts, which starts to feel cumbersom as I have all my registered workouts in one single list and it starts to become cumbersome.

From this frustration, the idea to create my own minimalistic app to register my workouts was born.

## Goal and purpose
The app allows to register my workouts in an easy way. All that is needed is:
* Starting a workout
* For each exercise performed, provide:
  * The exercise name
  * How many reps you have done for that exercise for that set

The app will then register the workout with information about each exercise, how many sets you have done per exercise and how many reps per set.
