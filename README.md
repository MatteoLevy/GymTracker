# GymTracker
A minimalistic program to track workouts.

## Background
I train at the gym and I use Google Keep to register my workouts, which starts to feel cumberson as I have all my registered workouts in one single list and it starts to become cumbersome.

## Goal and purpose
I want to create a minimalistic application to register my workouts in an easy way, i.e.:
* the exercise
* the reps for that exercise
  * for one or more sets.
